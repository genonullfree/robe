# Robe

(`ro-BE`)

Robe is a "Robot" created from the mind of Bean Nullfree (7). I (Geno) have done most of the work developing Robe, but it was Bean's idea and he has helped me write some parts of it. I have been working on this small script as a way to ease Bean into programming as he's expressed interest in developing a video game (thanks for setting unrealistic expectations, **Space Jam: A New Legacy**).

Robe is meant to be simple and an easy way to get (my) kids introduced to computers. It comes with a few mini-games such as a number guessing game, a typing game, and a customizable spelling quiz game.

## Dependencies

`bash` and `espeak` or `espeak-ng` are required to be installed so Robe can "speak."

The games are a bit weak but they're not intended to be super fantastic. It was just a fun father/son project that I felt like sharing in case anyone else might find it interesting.

## Notes

The creation of Robe was inspired by Bean's reading of the book "Think in Code" by Marcus J Carey (https://twitter.com/marcusjcarey). Thanks Marcus!
